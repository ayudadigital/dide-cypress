## Issues

Issues are always very welcome.

### Tell us

* What you are doing?
  * Post sample use case that reproduces the issue. Attaching the entire Dockerfile is the best option
* What do you expect to happen?
* What is actually happening?

When you post code, please use [Github flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown), in order to get proper syntax highlighting!
